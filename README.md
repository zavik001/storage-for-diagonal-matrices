# storage-for-diagonal-matrices

## Project Description

This project implements matrix-vector multiplication, where the matrix is stored in diagonal format to optimize memory usage and performance. The project includes the following functionalities:

1. **Matrix generation** — creates a matrix in diagonal format.
2. **Main program** — performs the matrix-vector multiplication.
3. **File conversion** — converts text files `.txt` to binary `.dat` format and vice versa.

## Project Structure

- `generator/` — contains the code for matrix generation.
- `main/` — contains the main program for matrix-vector multiplication.
- `conversion/` — contains the program for converting files between `.txt` and `.dat` formats.

## How to Run the Project

1. Compile and run the matrix generation:
   ```bash
   make run1
2. Compile and run the main program (matrix-vector multiplication):
   ```bash
   make run2
3. Compile and run the file conversion program:
   ```bash
   make run3
